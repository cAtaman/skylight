1) props in MasterDB -> grading rule, current session
2) On result auto computation, update level in personal info table
3) Sheets report generation
4) Backup and Restore DBs
5) Clear all logs (superuser)
6) Fix child endpoint logging
7) HOD's access permission
8) Create session expose, change session updates personal info level (big red button)
9) Log user login
10) Search student by name (say surname) and perhaps streamlined to an entry session or some other filter ==> special cases
        --- perhaps by adding surname to master db
11) Solve the security issue with log.py printing account.post()'s data parameter (this includes new users' password)
12) show account title and possibly username in logs, id is too unspecific and changes overtime
13) Create logout endpoint
14) End user session after a period of inactivity (or heck activity)
    --[remember to take into account that logs.get() keeps getting called when the frontend is in main menu]
15) Periodically clear cache dir
16) Make results.py and course_reg.py logs available to logs.py
17) Make open_result_edit possible to activate for a single user
18) Make logs.py able to get log data with filter already applied (filter in backend?)
        ---Logs only filters already fetched data, this causes some problems,
19) Unify the data formats for input and output for /course_reg and /results
20) An asterisk next to level GPAs in reports when the courses for that level are not all passed
21) Add table in sessional dbs for logging result errors
