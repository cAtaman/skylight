1) course addition                                                        >>>>> done
2) props in MasterDB -> grading rule, current session
3) On result auto computation, update level in personal info and course reg if present
        recompute categories and update gpas, credits passed for level (modify GPAs table in DB to tuple of passed credits and GPAs) >>>>> done

5) Add extra column in Resultsx00 to handle unregistered courses          >>>>> done
6) Sheets report generation
7) Backup and Restore DBs

9) Fix child endpoint logging
10) HOD's access permission
11) Create session expose, change session updates personal info level
12) Make sure course reg and Result table have matching tables            >>>>> done
13) Log user login
14) Search student by name (say surname) and perhaps streamlined to an entry session or some other filter ==> special cases
        --- perhaps by adding surname to master db
15) Solve the security issue with log.py printing account.post()'s data parameter (this includes new users' password)
16) show account title and possibly username in logs, id is too unspecific and changes overtime
17) Create logout endpoint
18) End user session after a period of inactivity (or heck activity)
    --[remember to take into account that logs.get() keeps getting called when the frontend is in main menu]
19) Periodically clear cache dir
20) Unify the data formats for input and output for /course_reg and /results
