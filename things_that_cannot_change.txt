These are core logic assumptions the program requires to function and cannot be changed without breaking something.
Add to the list things you absolutely depend on
Also just in case of revisions, add why this is necessary

1) Levels must be from 100 or 200 or 300 to 800 (Depending on mode of entry)
   * Results are computed using Result100 - Result800 for all cases
2) Courses must be from 100 to 500
   * Used in generating the Course Reg columns and Result columns, Iter over Courses100 to 500 in courses.db
3) Mode of entry either starts from 100, 200 or 300 and ends in 500
   * Used in generating the courses and credits in 100 to 500 for Courses and Credits Table
4) Usernames and passwords cannot contain colons(:)
   * Used in users.py, colons act as separators
5) Exposed endpoints which use access_decorator must have logs and perms defined in users.py
   * Used by access_decorator to det the necessary permissions for access and the logs to parse log output messages
6) Exposed endpoints which use access_decorator must and take in mat_no as an input arg must use the arg name mat_no
   * This is indexed as a kwarg in the access_decorator fn
7) If probate twice, then you're out
   * Max years accountable is 8 years as Results and CourseReg end at 800
8) Scores must be over 100 (percentages)
   * Grading rule uses 100 as first grade upper bound
9) Session pair must be session / (session+1)
   * Session admitted in Personal Info post uses this to choose DB, session loading depends on this uniformity
10) Mat nos must be of length 10
   * DB Model file limited to 10 max chars mat_no in Personal Info
11) The precision for gpas and cgpas is 4dp
   * The DegreeClass table stores a tuple of the range for each class of degree as a float with a precision of 4dp
12) course_details.get_all(level, use_curr_session=True) must return one and only one placeholder optional course
   * The position of this course in the course list is used for placing the OPTIONAL COURSES column in the broad-sheet
