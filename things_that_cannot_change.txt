These are core logic assumptions the program requires to function and cannot be changed without breaking something.
Add to the list things you absolutely depend on
Also just in case of revisions, add why this is necessary

1) Levels must be from 100 or 200 or 300 to 800 (Depending on mode of entry)
   * Results are computed using Result100 - Result800 for all cases
2) Courses must be from 100 to 500
   * Used in generating the Course Reg columns and Result columns, Iter over Courses100 to 500 in courses.db
3) Mode of entry either starts from 100, 200 or 300 and ends in 500
   * Used in generating the courses and credits in 100 to 500 for Courses and Credits Table
4) Usernames and passwords cannot contain colons(:)
   * Used in users.py, colons act as separators
5) Exposed endpoints which use access_decorator must have req_perms as last default arg in fn definition
   * Used in access_decorator to det the necessary permissions for access
6) Exposed endpoints which use access_decorator must and take in mat_no as an input arg must use the arg name mat_no
   * This is indexed as a kwarg in the access_decorator fn
7) If probate twice, then you're out
   * Max years accountable is 8 years as Results and CourseReg end at 800
8) Scores must be over 100 (percentages)
   * Grading rule uses 100 as first grade upper bound
